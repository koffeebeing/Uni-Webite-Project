         <p> Following the UK's exit from the European Union, the UK government has confirmed that EU, EEA and Swiss nationals starting courses in the 2021/22 academic year onwards, who are not registered as 'settled or 'pre-settled' in the UK will no longer be eligible for home/UK fee status or financial support from Student Finance England.<br><br>

This means that these students will pay the same fees as international student
